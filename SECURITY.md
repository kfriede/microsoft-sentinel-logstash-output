## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Here's how you can report a vulnerability:**

1. Send an email to our security team at [security@xxx.com](mailto:security@xxx.com). If possible, please use a descriptive subject line.

2. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability. This may include the steps to reproduce, the potential impact, and any proposed fixes or workarounds.

3. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

**What to expect after reporting a vulnerability:**

1. Confirmation of receipt: Within 3 business days of your report, we aim to acknowledge that we've received your report. We'll also attempt to confirm the vulnerability if it's not immediately obvious.

2. Regular updates: Every 5 business days, we'll send you an email updating you on the status of your report. This may include confirmation of the vulnerability, details of any fixes or workarounds, and an estimated timeline for a fix.

3. Public disclosure: Once we've addressed the vulnerability, we'll make a public announcement. If you wish, we can acknowledge your contribution in this announcement.

Please note that we will respect your privacy and will only use your personal information to correspond with you about this report.
